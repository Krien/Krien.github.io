<h2> Thesis Supervision </h2>
I am looking for students to supervise (MSc) that are interested in storage systems. I have topics regarding performance analysis, QoS tracing and LSM-trees.
If you are interested please contact me or join our weekly StoNet-research meeting on Tuesday.

I have previously co-supervised:
<ul>
    <li> WIP, Sudarsan Sivakumar (MSc thesis) </li>
    <li> WIP, Gleb Mishchenko (HP Project) </li>
    <li> 2024, Darko Vujica (BSc thesis) -- "Exploring Redis Persistence Modes: Introducing AOFURing, an io_uring AOF Extension" </li>
    <li> 2024, Vincent Kohm (BSc thesis) -- "Optimizing Metadata Handling with vkFS: A Hybrid Key-Value Store File System leveraging RocksDB"</li>
    <li> 2024, Sudarsan Sivakumar (MSc literature survey) -- "A survey on flash storage disaggregation: performance and quality of service considerations" </li>
</ul>

<h2> Courses </h2>
For my PhD, I have been involved as a teaching assistant (along with coordinating roles) for the following courses:
<ul>
    <li> 2023--2024, <a href="https://research.vu.nl/en/courses/systems-seminar-2"> System Seminar (MSc)</a>: Teaching students how to read <i>and</i> review systems papers, and how to reproduce systems artifacts.</li>
    <li> 2023--2024, <a href="https://research.vu.nl/en/courses/advanced-network-programming-2"> Advanced Network Programming (BSc)</a>: Teaching students how to design, implement and evaluate network stacks (among others they implement ICMP and TCP in user-space).</li>
    <li> 2023, <a href="https://atlarge-research.com/courses/storage-systems-vu/"> Storage Systems (MSc)</a>: Teaching students how to design, implement and evaluate storage systems (they implement an FTL, GC algorithm and FS).</li>
</ul>

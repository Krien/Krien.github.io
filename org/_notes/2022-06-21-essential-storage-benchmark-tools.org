This page contains a list of benchmarking tools on GNU/Linux that I at least know of and that are known to work pretty well. I am sure that I am missing a few, but please bear with me. I come back to this page to see what tools to use.

- perf (https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page)
- FlameGraph (https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph)
- iostat (https://linux.die.net/man/1/iostat)
- ftrace (https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/trace/ftrace.html)
- blktrace (https://linux.die.net/man/8/blktrace)
- bcc (https://github.com/iovisor/bcc)
- bpftrace (https://github.com/iovisor/bpftrace)
- nvme-cli, smart-montools, blkzone or another tool to get raw statistics from NVMe devices
- fio (https://github.com/axboe/fio), for testing file I/O, but also for testing IO frameworks (libaio, SPDK, iouring, etc)

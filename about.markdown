Krijn Doekemeijer is a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Systems (CS) at the VU Amsterdam ([AtLarge](https://atlarge-research.com/kdoekemeijer/)). He is also part of [StoNet-research](https://stonet-research.github.io/).
Currently, he is researching how to characterize and improve the performance quality of service (QoS) of storage systems in data centers (e.g., SSDs, I/O schedulers, file systems, databases, and performance modeling, to name a few). To see what he has been up to, look at his [/cv](https://krien.github.io/cv) or [/publications](https://krien.github.io/publications).

Krijn has a joint MSc Computer Science degree (specialised in Big Data Engineering) from the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (VU) and Universiteit van Amsterdam (UvA), and a BSc in Computer Science (specialized in Gametech) from Utrecht University (UU).

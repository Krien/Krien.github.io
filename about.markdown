I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (VU) and part of the Massivizing Computer Systems group ([AtLarge](https://atlarge-research.com/kdoekemeijer/)).
I am also a part of [StoNet-research](https://stonet-research.github.io/).
My research area is scheduling storage and networked systems.
I have a Msc Computer Science degree (specialised in Big Data Engineering) from the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (VU) and Universiteit van Amsterdam (UvA), and a Bsc in Computer Science/Gametech from Utrecht University.
If you want to contact me feel free to do so! I will probably not respond to emails, I prefer GitHub for code related stuff and LinkedIn for work related stuff (see socials).
To see what I have been up to, look at my [/cv](https://krien.github.io/cv), [/publications](https://krien.github.io/publications) or my [/notes](https://krien.github.io/notes).

This site is hosted with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) using  [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) with the [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme.
All notes are written with Emacs [Org Mode](https://orgmode.org/).

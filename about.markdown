I am a computer scientist with a Msc Computer Science degree (specialised in Big Data Engineering) from the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (VU) and Universiteit van Amsterdam (UvA).
My main areas of interest are Storage Systems and Big Data. However, I am also interested in Programming Languages, Graphics, and Software and Hardware in general. If you want to contact me feel free to do so! I will probably not respond to emails, I prefer GitHub for code related stuff and LinkedIn for work related stuff (see socials). To see what I have been up to, look at my [/cv](https://krien.github.io/cv), [/publications](https://krien.github.io/publications) or my [/notes](https://krien.github.io/notes).

This site is hosted with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) using  [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) with the [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme. All notes are written with Emacs [Org Mode](https://orgmode.org/). The source code is available at [Github](https://github.com/Krien/Krien.github.io).

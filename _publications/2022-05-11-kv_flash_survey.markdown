<h2>Abstract</h2>
Key-value stores (KV) have become one of the main components of the modern storage and data processing system
stack. With the increasing need for timely data analysis, performance becomes more and more critical. In the past, these
stores were frequently optimised to run on HDD and DRAM
devices. However, the last decade saw an increased interest in
the use of flash devices because of their attractive properties.
Flash is cheaper than DRAM and yet has a lower latency and
higher throughput than HDDs. This literature survey aims to
highlight the changes proposed in the last decade to optimise
key-value stores for flash devices and predict what role these
devices might play for key-value stores in the future.
